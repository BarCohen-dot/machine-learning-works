# Machine Learning - Works ðŸš€

Welcome to my collection of machine learning works! This repository showcases various techniques, algorithms, and models Iâ€™ve been working on. From data preprocessing to training and evaluation, you'll find everything you need to understand how machine learning works.

## ðŸ§  What's inside?

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Training various models including classification, regression, and clustering.
- **Evaluation**: Testing and evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and more.
- **Educational Insights**: Every model and technique comes with an explanation to help you learn!

## ðŸ“Š Techniques & Algorithms

- **Classification**: Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, etc.
- **Regression**: Linear and Non-linear regression models.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together.
- **Cross-validation & Metrics**: Ensuring our models work on various datasets and measuring their accuracy.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-works.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run any script to explore machine learning in action!
